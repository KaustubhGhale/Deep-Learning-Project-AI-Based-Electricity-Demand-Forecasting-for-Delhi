# Deep-Learning-Project-AI-Based-Electricity-Demand-Forecasting-for-Delhi
Delhi's power demand fluctuates due to seasonal changes, daily temperature variations, and uneven urban growth, creating challenges in balancing power generation with demand. This project aims to develop an AI-based model to accurately forecast electricity demand, factoring in weather conditions, holidays, and urban development.
