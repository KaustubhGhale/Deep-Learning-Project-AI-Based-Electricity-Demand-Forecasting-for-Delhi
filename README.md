# Deep-Learning-Project-AI-Based-Electricity-Demand-Forecasting-for-Delhi

PROBLEM STATEMENT:

Delhi's power demand fluctuates due to seasonal changes, daily temperature variations, and uneven urban growth, creating challenges in balancing power generation with demand. This project aims to develop an AI-based model to accurately forecast electricity demand, factoring in weather conditions, holidays, and urban development.

ABSTRACT:

In the modern era of soaring energy demands and unpredictable consumption patterns, the need for precise electricity forecasting has never been more urgent. Delhi, a bustling metropolis with dynamic urban growth and extreme weather variability, poses a complex challenge for energy management. Without accurate predictions, power grids risk blackouts, inefficiencies, and resource wastage. This project tackles these pressing issues by harnessing the power of artificial intelligence to develop a state-of-the-art electricity demand forecasting model. By integrating diverse factors such as weather data, holiday patterns, and temporal trends, this AI-driven solution is designed to decode the intricate tapestry of Delhi's energy needs, ensuring smarter energy allocation and sustainable urban living.  

The methodology is a fusion of innovation and precision: Random Forests handle complex, non-linear relationships; LSTM networks unravel temporal dependencies with unparalleled accuracy, and ARIMA offers interpretable statistical insights. From feature engineering that incorporates cyclic patterns and lagged variables to rigorous evaluations using MAE and RMSE, every step of this project is meticulously crafted. The results are striking, showcasing the LSTMâ€™s dominance in pattern recognition while complementing the strengths of traditional and ensemble methods. This groundbreaking model promises not just to stabilize grids and mitigate power crises but to redefine how cities like Delhi approach energy planning in the face of uncertainty.
